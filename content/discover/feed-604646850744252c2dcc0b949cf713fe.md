  last_post_title: 'Debugging BeagleBoard USB boot with a sniffer: fixing omap_loader
    on modern PCs'
  last_post_description: This post is about the original OMAP3530 BeagleBoard from
    2008. Yes, the one so old that it doesn’t even show up in the board list on BeagleBoard.org
    anymore. The BeagleBoard, not the BeagleBone.

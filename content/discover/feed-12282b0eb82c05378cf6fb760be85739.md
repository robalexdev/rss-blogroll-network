  last_post_title: pass using stateless OpenPGP command line interface
  last_post_description: |-
    Yesterday I wrote about how
    I am using a different tool for git signing and verification. Next, I
    replaced my pass usage. I have a small
    patch to use
    stateless OpenPGP command line interface (SOP).

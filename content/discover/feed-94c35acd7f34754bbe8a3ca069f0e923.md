  last_post_title: 'odinlang: Odin looks like a promising C replacement'
  last_post_description: |-
    I used to write a lot of C code.
    But after working with Go, C felt antiquated and error-prone.
    Odin is picking up steam so I wanted to try it and share my experience.
    The result?
    I like it

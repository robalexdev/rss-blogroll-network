  last_post_title: 'Emacs Quick Tip: Disable key bindings with global-unset-key'
  last_post_description: Do you also hate some of Emacs' default keybindings? Some
    of the default key bindings in Emacs don't really feel right for me, so I unset/remove
    them. Sometimes I override them with new operations.
